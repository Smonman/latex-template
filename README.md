# latex-template

## Language

This is a simple LaTeX article template. On default this template is set to be German, but this can be easily changed by changing the line where the [Babel](https://ctan.org/pkg/babel) packege is loaded. Change:
```tex
\usepackage[english,ngerman]{babel}
```
to:
```tex
\usepackage[english]{babel}
```
if you want this document to be set to English.

> __Note__: That the only supported languages for now are English and German.
